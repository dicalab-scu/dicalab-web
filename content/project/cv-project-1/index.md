The project builds an interactive and shared cataract ultrasound database and researches artificial intelligence-based cataract intelligent diagnosis models and algorithms, and also researches breakthroughs in the key technologies of ultrasonic diagnostic audio and video real-time acquisition, compression, transmission, and deep learning intelligent diagnosis, and develops an intelligent cloud platform for cataract diagnosis . The research and development of a remote ultrasound cataract diagnosis system based on artificial intelligence will significantly improve the efficiency of screening and diagnosis of eye diseases for patients, and provide reliable assistance for scientifically formulating relevant treatment plans. Through remote ultrasound diagnosis technology, it solves the serious shortage of professional ophthalmologists in primary medical institutions in remote areas, and expands to the treatment and research of more eye diseases. It is expected to carry out 30 application demonstrations in the primary medical field in remote areas of Sichuan Province, serving more than 5,000 people in remote mountainous areas.
