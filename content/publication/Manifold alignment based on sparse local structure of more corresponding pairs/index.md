abstract: "Manifold alignment is to extract the shared latentsemantic  structure  from  multiple  manifolds.   Thejoint  adjacency  matrix  plays  a  key  role  in  mani-fold alignment.  To construct the matrix, it is cru-cial  to  get  more  corresponding  pairs.This  pa-per  proposes  an  approach  to  obtain  more  and  re-liable corresponding pairs in terms of local struc-ture  correspondence.The  sparse  reconstructionweight  matrix  of  each  manifold  is  established  topreserve  the  local  geometry  of  the  original  dataset.  The sparse correspondence matrices are con-structed using the sparse local structures of corre-sponding pairs across manifolds.  Further more, anew energy function for manifold alignment is pro-posed to simultaneously match the correspondinginstances and preserve the local geometry of eachmanifold. The shared low dimensional embedding,which  provides  better  descriptions  for  the  intrin-sic geometry and relations between different man-ifolds, can be obtained by solving the optimizationproblem  with  closed-form  solution.   Experimentsdemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algo-rithm."
