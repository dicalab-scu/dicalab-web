Different EA-based NAS algorithms may utilize different encoding schemes for network representation, while they have the same workflow (i.e., the initialization of the population, individual evaluation, and evolution). Because each individual needs complete training and validation on the target dataset, the EA-based NAS always consumes significant computation and time inevitably, which results in the bottleneck of this approach. To ameliorate this issue, this paper proposes a distributed framework to boost the computing of the EA-based NAS. This framework is a server/worker model where the server distributes individuals, collects the validated individuals and hosts the evolution operations. Meanwhile, the most time-consuming phase (i.e., individual evaluation) is allocated to the computational workers. Additionally, a new packet structure of the message delivered in the cluster is designed to encapsulate various network representation of different EA-based NAS algorithms. We design an EA-based NAS algorithm as a sample to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments are performed on an illustrative cluster with different scales, and the results reveal that the framework can achieve a nearly linear reduction of the training time with the increase of the computational workers.","tags":null,"title":"A distributed framework for EA-based NAS.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

An expansion of the training set is a common way to improve the performance of neural networks in small-sample learning tasks. However, improper constraints in expanding training data will reduce the performance of the neural networks. In this article, we present certain conditions for incorporation of additional training data. According to these conditions, we propose a neural network framework for self-training using self-generated data called small-sample learning network (SSLN). The SSLN consists of two parts: the expression learning network and the sample recall generative network, both of which are constructed based on restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). We show that this SSLN can converge as well as the RBM.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework, dubbed BFGAN, to address this challenge. Specifically, we employ a backward generator and a forward generator to generate lexically constrained sentences together, and use a discriminator to guide the joint training of two generators by assigning them reward signals. Due to the difficulty of BFGAN training, we propose several training techniques to make the training process more stable and efficient. Our extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets with human evaluation demonstrate that BFGAN has significant improvements over previous methods.","tags":null,"title":"BFGAN: Backward and Forward Generative Adversarial Networks for Lexically Constrained Sentence Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JiaBijue","Jiancheng Lv","XiPeng","YaoChen","Shenglan Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586217600,"objectID":"76ec0da49d06d6a18267924beed21d42","permalink":"/publication/hierarchical-regulated-iterative-network/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hierarchical-regulated-iterative-network/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

When the data set is rich enough, increasing the scale of the neural network can obtain higher prediction accuracy, which has been verified in a series of research fields including text, image, audio, etc. However, the current problems of modular neural network design are mainly concentrated in a single field, solving problems based on data characteristics, rather than discovering the semantic relationship of data like the human brain, so the interpretability and robustness are not good. This project proposes a method to build a super large-scale neural network system based on the functional mechanism of the human brain. The system is based on brain-like and neural network research, integrating a large amount of existing data and pre-training models, and breaking through the existing deep neural network processing functions The single defect aims to design a new generation of neural network models, realize human-like knowledge storage and reasoning, and move towards general artificial intelligence. The entire system includes the foundation of brain function research, the construction of a brain-like functional neural network library, and how to design a large-scale neural network model component platform based on the brain function collaborative work mechanism and the brain-like neural network library. At the same time, in order to achieve efficient training of super-large-scale neural networks, the system provides a distributed neural network training platform and training algorithms. Finally, the system is verified on multiple different modal tasks.\n","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"6f5a4669bd5daf706222801cb029eefc","permalink":"/project/bigdata-project-1/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bigdata-project-1/","section":"project","summary":"This paper presents a method to build a super large scale neural network system","tags":["BigData"],"title":"Brain like large scale neural network system","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Please use Wechat to scan the QR code above to open the Budongwenyan APP\n","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"59ad66dd7f50d461049b29b595390de7","permalink":"/project/nlp-project-2/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nlp-project-2/","section":"project","summary":"This is an introduction to Budongwenyan","tags":["NLP"],"title":"Budongwenyan xiaofan(不懂文言)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Please use Wechat to scan the QR code above to open the Chuanxiaomei APP\n","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"fe62ba11f31602f1678b9d335c066135","permalink":"/project/nlp-project-1/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nlp-project-1/","section":"project","summary":"This is an introduction to Chuanxiaomei","tags":["NLP"],"title":"Chuanxiaomei(川小妹)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project proposes an end-to-end craniofacial restoration technology based on deep learning, and develops a fast and high-precision craniofacial restoration intelligent cloud platform. This project aims to explore the application of artificial intelligence in forensic anthropology. Skull facial restoration is one of the key points of forensic anthropology. Its core significance lies in identity recognition, such as identification by relatives and friends, and retrieval in the face database. In addition, craniofacial restoration is also of great significance to archaeological research. It can help archaeological researchers restore the appearance of ancient people and provide evidence for archaeological research results. In the future, the artificial intelligence-based craniofacial restoration system will be applied to the identification of victims in criminal investigation cases to provide assistance in case detection. It will also be applied to archaeological research to bring history closer to modern times.\n","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"bfb65477d343504590d855217d878d8d","permalink":"/project/cv-project-2/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cv-project-2/","section":"project","summary":"End to end craniofacial reconstruction based on deep learning","tags":["CV"],"title":"Craniofacial reconstruction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The project builds an interactive and shared cataract ultrasound database and researches artificial intelligence-based cataract intelligent diagnosis models and algorithms, and also researches breakthroughs in the key technologies of ultrasonic diagnostic audio and video real-time acquisition, compression, transmission, and deep learning intelligent diagnosis, and develops an intelligent cloud platform for cataract diagnosis .
